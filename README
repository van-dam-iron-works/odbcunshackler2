Older windows

It is likely that people will want to use this program to access ODBC databases
on old and unsupported Windows versions. No effort has been made to make sure
this works. However PEP-11 should get you started on backporting this to
older versions of Python and Windows.

For Win9x, WinME, NT4 you would have to backport to Python 2.5
For Windows 2000 you would have to backport to Python 2.7 or 3.2
For WinXP you would have to backport to Python 2.7 or 3.4
